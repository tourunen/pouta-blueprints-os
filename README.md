** This is a POC modification of PB to run on OpenShift. It does not actually do anything meaningful, yet **

# Pouta Blueprints

**Pouta Blueprints** is a frontend to manage cloud resources and lightweight user
accounts.
Currently supported resource types are 
 - [OpenStack driver](pouta_blueprints/drivers/provisioning/openstack_driver.py),
    which can be used to launch instances on OpenStack cloud.
 - [Docker driver] (pouta_blueprints/drivers/provisioning/README_docker_driver.md),
    for running web notebook instances in Docker containers on a pool of virtual machines. 
 - [Pouta Virtualcluster](https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/pouta-virtualcluster),
    which can be used to launch clusters on [cPouta](https://research.csc.fi/pouta-iaas-cloud).
    
Additional resources can be added by implementing the driver interface [/pouta_blueprints/drivers/provisioning/base_driver.py](pouta_blueprints/drivers/provisioning/base_driver.py)
